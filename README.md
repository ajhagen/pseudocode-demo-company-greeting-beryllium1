### Requirements

1. Write a unique morning greeting for each day of the week.

2. If today is Thursday and Friday is a holiday, begrudgingly demand that the employee enjoy their "long weekend."

3. Check the employee's current hours for the week. If they are getting close to overtime, remind the employee of their current hours with a warning.
